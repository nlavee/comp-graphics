This is part of my work with Computer Graphics using JOGL in Java. 

This project contains base code from instructor that I built up from to achieve certain tasks. For example, implementing Bresenham Line and Circle Algorithm. The project will continue to grow as I learn more techniques and algorithms.

Checklist for algorithms implemented:

* Bresenham's Line Algorithm (Works with any pair of points).
* Circle Drawing Algorithm.
*
